# “你同意吗？”到底是 Are you agree?还是 Do you agree ?

**01 “你同意吗？”如何表达？**

**agree 已经是动词了**，所以就不用 be 动词 are，只能加**助动词 do**来帮助构成疑问句

正确的表达是：

👇

**Do you agree ?**

_例：_

_I think we should stop, do you agree?我觉得我们该停止了，你同意吗？_

_I must know your opinion. Do you agree with them?我必须知道你的意见。你同意他们的意见吗？_

如果同意，回答：**Yes,I agree.**是比较常用的

**Yes,I do.**在语法上也是正确的，但比较少使用

如果不同意，则说：**No, I really can't agree.**

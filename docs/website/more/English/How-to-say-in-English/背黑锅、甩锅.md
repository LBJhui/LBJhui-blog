**③ pass the buck**

据说，以前人们玩纸牌的时候会轮着发牌，而发牌的人会拿到一把刀，这把刀就代表发牌权。

而且这种刀的刀柄通常是用（buck）雄鹿的角做的，所以当轮到某个人发牌时，buck 就会传给这个人，表示发牌权到了这个人手上。

慢慢地

pass the buck 就演变成了“把责任推给别人”

也就是我们说的甩锅了

> pass the buck
>
> to blame someone or make them responsible for a problem that you should deal with
>
> 推卸责任

_例：_

_She's always trying to pass the buck and I'm sick of it!她老是想甩锅，我非常讨厌这一点。_
